            <h3> What I learnt while being at Life Choices: </h3>
            
                <ul>
                
                <li> <b> <i> FROM MY CLASSMATES </i> </b> - I learnt that I should feel free and should not shy away from asking for assistance when I am stuck on a problem. </li>
                <li> <b> <i> FROM MY LECTURERS </i> </b> - From my coding lecturers, I learnt more about coding and I appreciate that they touched on topics that I was interested in that my high school teachers did not touch on. From my life skills lecturer, I learnt about the leadership skills and how they would benefit me in future. From my other lecturer, I learnt about Eneagramme. </li>
                <li> <b> <i> FROM THE ATMOSPHERE </i> </b> - What I learnt as soon as I entered the gates of the establishment was that this is the place I wanted to be. The classrooms are nice and cosy, making them comfortable enough for me to concentrate on my work. When I am in need of some fresh air, I can step out to the establishment's yard. </li>
